## Unit 2.3 – Advanced Data Fetching (SSG, SSR, ISR)

This project demonstrates all three Next.js App Router rendering strategies.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Route: /about
- Generated at build time
- Used for static informational content

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Route: /dashboard
- Rendered on every request
- Used for real-time, user-specific data

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Route: /events
- Revalidated every 60 seconds
- Balances performance and freshness

Screenshots are included under screenshots/unit-2-3/.
